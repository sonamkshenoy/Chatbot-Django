# UniBot : *A Django App*

Unibot is a Web Application for chatbot, built using Bootstrap, Django, Firebase and deployed on Heroku.
Interface facilitates smooth interaction. The website also has unique accounts for each user, thus making it more personalized!
Find UniBot at: **https://unibot-mlab.herokuapp.com**!
##### Note: Due to hefty size of the machine learning model, website takes some time to load, but does show up for sure after refreshing for a few times, if not the first time. :)

### Note:
To run the application:
1) Place your config credentials json from Firebase in every view.py.
2) Place "Key.json" of Google Dialogflow in the root folder.
3) Finally, run **python manage.py runserver** and have fun with the website!
