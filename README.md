# UniBot : *Chatbot-Django*

Unibot is a Web Application for chatbot, built using Bootstrap, Django and Firebase. It has been deployed on Heroku.
Find us at: **https://unibot-mlab.herokuapp.com**!
##### Note: Due to hefty size of the machine learning model, website takes some time to load, but does show up for sure after refreshing for a few times, if not the first time. :)

### Note:
To run the application:
1) Place your config credentials json from Firebase in every view.py.
2) Place "Key.json" of Google Dialogflow in the root folder.
